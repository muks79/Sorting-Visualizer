Sorting Visualizer
Overview

Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer! This project is designed to help you understand various sorting algorithms by visualizing them in action. It provides a clear and interactive way to see how different algorithms process data to sort it.
Features

    Interactive Visualization: Watch as sorting algorithms sort an array of numbers step-by-step.
    Multiple Algorithms: Includes popular sorting algorithms such as:
        Bubble Sort
        Selection Sort
        Insertion Sort
        Merge Sort
        Quick Sort
    Customizable Speed: Adjust the speed of the visualization to observe each step in detail or see the complete process quickly.
    Array Customization: Generate random arrays of different sizes and values or input your own array for sorting.
    User-friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface to select and visualize different sorting algorithms.
